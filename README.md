This is a Project in which I have proposed my plans for Sugarizer Security and Availability project using 
NodeJs, [speakeasy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@levminer/speakeasy) and Express.

## Running the app



	git clone https://github.com/ricknjacky/sugarizer-2FA.git
	cd sugarizer-2FA
	npm i
	node index.js

Server will start running on port 3000.
Now browse to the URL http://localhost:3000
